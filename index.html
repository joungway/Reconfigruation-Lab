  <p>In many design, I found that a lot of new and unique items have a creative process of reconfiguration through deconstruction. For example, metal oxide to produce a new color. In addition to the process of deconstruction and reorganization, the common feature of them is the designer cannot fully control the final appearance, because there are some natural forces involved in such process, such as oxidation, cracking, melting. That is the reason why the projects can be unique.</P>

  <p>In this site, there is my relevant research poster and two interesting ideas from other designers.</p>
